## Background

In a series of projects, I embarked on a journey to deeply understand the nuances behind the numbers that narrate the story of global healthâ€”specifically, life expectancy. This endeavor was twofold: initially, to meticulously clean the World Life Expectancy dataset, addressing and rectifying inconsistencies to pave the way for accurate analysis. Subsequently, I shifted my focus to exploratory analysis, aiming to uncover the trends and shifts in life expectancy across different nations over time. Through SQL queries and data manipulation, I sought to reveal the underlying patterns that might explain how and why life expectancy changes in different contexts.

## Questions

My exploration was guided by a set of questions, each aimed at uncovering layers of insight hidden within the data:
- After ensuring data integrity, what can the clean dataset reveal about global life expectancy trends?
- Which countries have experienced the most significant changes in life expectancy, and what might these changes indicate about global health progress and challenges?
- How do the findings contribute to our understanding of public health, policy effectiveness, and global disparities?

## Main Findings

The journey through data cleaning to exploratory analysis led to several key findings:
- **Data Quality**: The initial phase of data cleaning was crucial, revealing substantial duplications and inconsistencies that, once addressed, significantly enhanced the dataset's reliability for analysis.
- **Significant Shifts**: The exploratory analysis highlighted remarkable changes in life expectancy, with some countries showing dramatic improvements, underscoring the potential impact of health policies, economic development, and social factors.
- **Disparities and Progress**: The analysis brought to light not only the successes but also the ongoing disparities in health outcomes, reflecting a complex interplay of global health dynamics.

## Conclusions

This comprehensive exploration of the World Life Expectancy dataset has underscored the importance of data integrity and the power of data analysis in uncovering critical insights into global health trends. By identifying both the strides made and challenges remaining, this project contributes valuable perspectives to the conversation on public health and policy formulation. The cleaned and analyzed dataset serves as a foundational resource for further research, offering a clearer picture of where efforts may be best directed to improve life expectancy worldwide.

## Process

The process encompassed several detailed steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Starting with an in-depth examination and cleaning of the dataset to ensure data accuracy and usability for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Employing SQL queries to investigate changes in life expectancy, identifying countries with significant improvements or declines, and analyzing the factors influencing these trends.

3. **Insight Synthesis**: Drawing connections between the data findings and broader global health narratives, providing a grounded understanding of the dynamics at play.
4. **Verification and Reflection**: Continually verifying the findings and reflecting on the implications for global health policies and interventions.
