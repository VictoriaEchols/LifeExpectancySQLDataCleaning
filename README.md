**Background:**


In this project, I delve into the fascinating yet complex World Life Expectancy dataset, which catalogues various health indicators across different countries and years. My primary motivation was to clean and refine this dataset to unlock its full potential for analysis. The data is rich with insights into how life expectancy is influenced by myriad factors, offering a lens through which we can examine global health trends. Through meticulous data cleaning, I aimed to address inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for deeper analytical exploration, making it a more reliable resource for public health research and policy analysis.


**Questions:**

Driven by curiosity and a commitment to contributing valuable insights to the field of public health, I set out to answer several pressing questions:

How does life expectancy vary across different countries and over various time periods?
What specific data inconsistencies are present in the World Life Expectancy dataset, and how can I systematically identify and rectify them?
What are the key insights and trends that can be observed in the cleaned dataset regarding global health outcomes and disparities?


**Main Findings:**

Throughout the data cleaning process, I uncovered and addressed a number of critical findings:

**Data Duplication:**

I found a substantial amount of duplicate records, underscoring the necessity of thorough data cleaning to ensure the integrity of any subsequent analysis.

**Cleaning Methodology:** 

I developed and applied a systematic approach to data cleaning, which included the removal of duplicates and the correction of inconsistencies, vastly improving the dataset’s accuracy and reliability.

**Emerging Insights:** 

After cleaning, the dataset revealed fascinating trends, such as noticeable improvements in life expectancy in many countries, while also highlighting stark health disparities across different regions.

**Conclusions:**


This project has been a profound journey into the heart of data quality and its paramount importance in analytical research. The meticulous process of cleaning the World Life Expectancy dataset not only enhanced its value for future studies but also shed light on significant health trends and inequities worldwide. With a cleaner, more reliable dataset, I’m excited about the prospects of diving deeper into the analysis to unearth insights that could inform public health strategies and policies.

**Process:**


The journey to a cleaner dataset involved several deliberate and detailed steps:

**Initial Exploration:** 

I began by thoroughly examining the dataset to grasp its structure, content, and potential issues, setting the stage for effective cleaning.

**Duplicate Identification:** 

Using tailored SQL queries, I identified duplicate entries by examining combinations of country and year, revealing areas of concern that required attention.

**Data Cleaning Actions:** 

With precision, I executed SQL commands to eliminate duplicates and rectify identified inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset accurately represented the unique data points intended.

**Verification and Validation:** 

After the cleaning process, I meticulously reviewed the dataset to verify the success of my cleaning efforts, ensuring the integrity of the data was maintained and ready for analysis.
